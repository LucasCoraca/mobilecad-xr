// What the user does in XR, independent of OpenXR: hands in, model / panel poses, highlights and callbacks out. The OpenXR
// session (xr_session) and the headset-free preview both feed it HandInput every frame.
//
//   ray on the UI panel:  trigger = touch (tap, drag)   grip = move the panel (with sheets: that window)
//                         thumbstick up/down = scroll
//   ray on the model:     trigger click = pick the face / edge (into the document's selection)
//                         grip, or trigger held = grab: the model follows the hand (move + rotate)
//   both hands grabbing:  scale and turn the model between the hands
//   thumbstick (not on the panel): up/down scales, left/right turns the model
//   menu / A / X:         onMenu (the app shows / recentres the panel, or switches documents)
//
// With `onViewport` set (MobileCAD XR) the space around the panel is the app's 3D view: the trigger anywhere off the panel
// is a finger on that view (tap, drag, double tap) and pointing is a hovering mouse, so every tool of the app (picking,
// the sketcher, Draft points, drag arrows) works on the model in the room; the grip moves the model,
// B / Y opens the view's context menu. The app sends back what its view draws: preselection, overlay, the sketch.
//   scale badge (under the panel): shows the model's scale; its button switches true size (1 mm = 1 mm) on / off
//   build plate: a tabletop on the model's ground plane (FreeCAD's XY plane) around its origin, with a grid and the axes;
//                the model stands on it. Its rim is a handle: grip on the rim picks the table up and carries it (it
//                turns with your wrist and stays level), trigger on the rim slides it along where the ray points
